# JumpJet Rex (Work-in-progress)

## Pre-requisites
You will need the linux build of JumpJet Rex for this to (Potentially) work. 

## Install
Copy the contents of the (```jumpjetrex.zip```) folder into your ports folder. Copy everything from the JumpJet Rex Linux build into the jumpjetrex folder on your device. 

## Issues
While I think I am fulfilling all library requirements, I am getting a segmentation fault when trying to run it on my device. I do see several errors relating to some libraries which could just mean I am using the wrong version. Box86 should be able to run this game, but I dont have another device to verify.
