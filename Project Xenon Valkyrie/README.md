# Project Xenon Valkyrie

## Pre-requisites
You will need the Linux version of Project Xenon Valkyrie for this to work. (May work with the Windows if it uses a Runner file and not an exe)

## Install 
Simply copy the contents of the (```xenonvalkyrie.zip```) to your ports folder on your device. Copy everything from the Linux version of your Project Xenon Valkyrie's game directory into the xenonvalkyrie folder. 

## Issues 
The game tends to lag once you spawn into a stage. This may be better on a more powerful device like the RG552 but I sadly do not have one to test on at the moment.
