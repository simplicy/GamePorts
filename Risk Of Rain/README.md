# Risk of Rain (Work-in-progress)

## Pre-requisites
You will need either the GOG or Linux version of this game. If you have the GOG version, make sure to download the linux build. 

## Install
Copy the contents of the (```riskofrain.zip```) folder into your ports folder. Copy everything except the run.sh file from the linux version of Risk of Rain into the riskofrain folder. 

## Issues
Currently I have not been able to get past the title screen. I have been so far unable to get the game to recognize the gamepad in the main menu. Using an external mouse does not work as well. I am looking for a gamepad patch for the game that could fix these issues.
